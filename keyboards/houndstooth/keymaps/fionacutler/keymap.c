Sometimes it seems like none of the amateurs in this community can understand the subtle art of the human-computer interface. Let me paint this picture very slowly and deliberately for you. Lounging here retroflecting on my week; swirling a bit of Audry XO (neat, as God himself intended, haha) on my palate; loosening up and undoing one button at a time from my TOM FORD O'Connor in shark-skin (yes that's the same suit worn by James fucking Bond AKA Daniel Craig, thank you); there's a smokeless incense of clove and as I inhale deeply I can feel the troubles of my very difficult, mentally taxing job melt away. Are you beginning to see what kind of man I am? Can you take a gander what kind of HCI I use? No it is not some wannabe JLCPCB ergo trash board glued together by some flux-coughing neckbeard in his mom's basement.  I'm sure you've guessed by this point, but in case you're a bit slow let me give you another hint. It has stealthy flow like the wisps of incense snaking invisibly across my foyer. It has bold character like the high-class cognac still warming my throat. And just like my suit it's fucking expensive and you wish you could have one. That's right I'm talking about the TGR fucking Alice. \"But wait,\" you protest, oh ye of feeble mind,\n\"but I see a lot of Alice clones on mechmarket these days, what makes you so special?\" EVERYTHING. Hoho, but I digress, in this particular case (pun intended!) it's not a clone, nor simply the original, for even that is too quaint a trinket for me to yield even a crumb of my attention. This is an EXCLUSIVE tungsten carbide limited POWDER COATED edition sold exclusively in a private Vickery auction for literally 5 figures (sorry I can't tell you who ran it, of course I had to sign an NDA, but let me just say you know him if you are anyone at all in the upper echelons of the community) with a matching set of Burble Dweezil artisans. And by the way the switches are REAL Invyr Pandas I happily collected for under $5 a piece before the market was flooded with inferior knockoffs. As you can tell I am a man of suave and candor so imagine my horror at the shockingly ignorant DMs I received on Reddit tonight and how they simultaneously ruined my night and destroyed any hope I have for the redemption of this highly toxic group of lowlives we call \"enthusiasts\". One little fucking comment I made praising the Alice on an \"ergo\" thread and suddenly my inbox is flooded with \"Alice is a half measure,\" ugg, \"worst set of compromises to ergonomics,\" ugg, \"fails to introduce any significant columnular stagger,\" ugg ugg, you half-witted brutish cavemen. Then it came it, and turned my relaxing night upside down. The message that made me gag on my own bile and spill XO all over my crisp, fresh suit. \"ALiCe iS A fuCkIng trASsh keybboard,\" are you kidding me? Am I dealing with a bunch of children here? I'm absolutely done with you plebs, I won't socialize with a bunch of poor hipsters who can't even afford a full set of 60 keys. Goodbye and good riddance, I won't be abused by your toxic mob mentality one minute longer. DM me when you grow up and learn some basic class, or on second thought, don't, you couldn't afford my time.\n");
